## Introduction

The heart of Noclip is its beautiful and sleek forums. Categories are at the top level of your forums, being the main way to organize broader subjects.

Categories have a value called `weight` which allows you to change the order or what categories appear first. The higher the `weight` value the lower the category will appear in the list.

Categories can also have cosmetic changes with Rainbow (link later), for example a cover image, that allows you to customize the header for each category. This also uses this image as the background, which gives it more character and uniqueness.

## FAQ

### How do I lock a Category?

For example, you may want to lock the `official` default category. Locking a category disallows users making posts in any of the boards inside the category.

Locking a category can be done by going to your Dashboard and toggling the `Lock Category` button. Roles with the `forum:administrator` permission can still post in categories or boards that are locked

### What is a slug?

A slug is a URL friend version of the title, this allows for users to be able to reach the category from a link. Changing the slug will break links that were previously posted elsewhere, this is considered a `dangerous` action. However, this allows you to have control over what the link friendly url is called, which is beneficial to some users. A default `slug` is created when you make a title for your category.
