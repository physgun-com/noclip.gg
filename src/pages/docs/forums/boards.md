## Introduction
Boards are where your threads live, boards are inside categories. Think of this as "Announcements, Feedback, Rules" etc. Boards can be customized by adding a cover, and a icon, giving your forum a unique look with little to no effort.

### Sub Boards
You can also use sub-boards to further organize your forums, you can attach a sub-board to a `parent` board by selecting the `parent` dropdown and searching for the board you want.

## FAQ

### How do I lock a Board?

For example, you may want to lock the `official` default category. Locking a category disallows users making posts in any of the boards inside the category.

Locking a category can be done by going to your Dashboard and toggling the `Lock Category` button. Roles with the `forum:administrator` permission can still post in categories or boards that are locked

### What is a slug?

A slug is a URL friend version of the title, this allows for users to be able to reach the category from a link. Changing the slug will break links that were previously posted elsewhere, this is considered a `dangerous` action. However, this allows you to have control over what the link friendly url is called, which is beneficial to some users. A default `slug` is created when you make a title for your category.

### How do I change order of boards in a Category?
Boards have a value called `weight` which allows you to change the order or what boards appear first. The higher the `weight` value the lower the boards will appear in the list.
