## Introduction
Threads are the main way users will interact with your community. Threads can be pinned, putting them directly at the top of a board, giving further importance, for example pinning a rules thread in a board allowing users to find it easier.


### Customization
Threads can be customized to have a cover or a `thread color` allowing threads to stand out from others. (this is a rainbow feature)

## FAQ

### How do I lock a Thread?
Locking a thread can be done by going to your Dashboard and toggling the `Lock Thread` button. Roles with the `forum:administrator` permission can still post in categories, boards, or threads that are locked.

Locking a thread can also be done by going to the thread and clicking the `lock` icon. Clicking it again will unlock the thread.

### What is a slug?

A slug is a URL friend version of the title, this allows for users to be able to reach the category from a link. Changing the slug will break links that were previously posted elsewhere, this is considered a `dangerous` action. However, this allows you to have control over what the link friendly url is called, which is beneficial to some users. A default `slug` is created when you make a title for your category.

### How do I move a thread to a different board?
Moving threads can be beneficial to keep your forums organized. For example moving a thread in `moderator applications` to the `accepted` category.

To move a thread visit the thread in your forums, click the `move thread` icon. This will pop up a modal allowing you to search and select a new board for the thread to be moved to. This will also seamlessly move all the comments with it without you worrying about it.
